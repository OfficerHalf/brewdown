    <h1>Thundertree</h1>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>The ruin of an old town that was overrun by zombies and mutant plants.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <h1>Description</h1>
      <p>Gradually the trail becomes an old, overgrown lane winding between dilapidated buildings choked in vines and brush.
        Ahead of you, in the middle of the settlement, rises a steep hill, upon which stands &gt; a stone tower with a partially
        collapsed roof and an adjoining cottage. A dirt road hugs the base of the hill and wends its way between old stone
        houses, many of which are roofless ruins with &gt; interiors open to the elements. Other buildings appear more or
        less intact. The whole place is eerily silent.</p>
      <p>A wooden sign is nailed to a post nearby. It reads: &quot;DANGER! Plant monsters and zombies! Turn back now!&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>Areas</h2>
    <h3>1. Westernmost Cottage</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <h1>Description</h1>

      <h1>Description</h1>
      <p>These ruined side-by-side cottages look as though they might once have been the homes of prosperous shopkeepers or

        have begun to grow amidst the ruins.</p>

      <p>A weathered signboard by the door of this large building shows the faded image of a workhorse holding a flagon of ale.
        The building is sagging and dilapidated but is more intact than the ruins across the road. Though the ale is long
        gone, the faint smell of yeast still lingers in the air.</p>

      <p>[on the village/monsters]: &quot;The creatures are slow and easily avoided. Except the spiders.&quot;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>&quot;I've seen folk in black masks and cloaks skulking around the east side of town.&quot;</li>
        <li>&quot;I'm more concerned about the dragon. Ah. Yes, uh. You may want to leave.&quot;</li>
      </ul>
      <p>[on the dragon]: &quot;I've heard him called <strong>Venomfang</strong>. Nasty green thing. Young, but deadly all the
        same.&quot;</p>
      <p>[on Kobolds]: &quot;Some kobolds are occupying a ruined castle just a few miles south west of here.&quot; <em>(See: <strong>Hillfang Castle</strong>)</em></p>

    <h3>7. Dragon's Tower</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <h1>Description</h1>
      <p>At the top of the hill stands a round tower with a cottage attached. Both are in good condition, although half the
        tower's roof is gone. A door leads into the cottage, and several arrowslit windows are visible in the tower. You
        can't help but notice an eerie quiet in the area, and a strange, acrid smell in the air.</p>
      <p>The corpses of two hideous giant spiders are sprawled near the edge of the pathway which, judging by the track marks,
        were dragged here. Their bloated bodies are puckered and blistered, and appear to have been mauled by a large animal.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h4>Notes</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tower.</strong> A single room with a 40-foot-high ceiling.</li>

    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <h1>Description</h1>
      <p>You enter into a large round room. Four pillars, arranged in a square in the center mark the foundations. Stone walls
        tower above you, fading into darkness, punctuated by wooden joists that mark where floors once were and lined by
        a stone staircase that spirals up, clockwise, around the interior.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dragon.</strong> A young green dragon named <strong>Vurkahsuul</strong> has moved into the tower.</li>
      <li>Flies away if taken down to half health.</li>
      <li><strong>Cottage.</strong> Contains dusty furniture covered in webbing, but nothing of value.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="description">
      <h1>Vurkahsuul</h1>
      <p><strong>[from the shadows]:</strong> &quot;Valokein, fahdon, wah praav do Vurkahsuul. Fos drun hi wah dii angaar? …
        No? <em>sigh</em> Welcome, travellers, to the tower of Vurkahsuul. What brings you to my home?&quot;</p>
      <p><strong>[on Venomfang]:</strong> &quot;Venom…fang? Is that what that trial-some druid has named me? I smell his stench
        all over you, travellers. Did he send you here to kill me in my lair? He wants my treasure you know.&quot;</p>
      <p><strong>[on his origin]:</strong> &quot;Our kind have flown the world since long before the days of Elves and men.
        Before even Elgaer bore her scars at The Calamity.&quot;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="description">
      <h1>Appearance</h1>
      <p>From above you, piercing emerald eyes flash briefly in the darkness, and from the deeper shadows emerges a broad, Cheshire
        grin. A green blur, like a whirlwind of leaves, spirals down a nearby pillar, and in an instant, the dragon is upon
        you.</p>
      <p>A little larger than a horse, this beast is far from fully grown, but terrifying all the same. Scales ripple, cascading
        down its form like fallen leaves as it moves, swaying its head back and forward, looking lazily between each of you.</p>

    <blockquote>

      <h1>Description</h1>
      <p>On the east side of town, the lane opens up to form a small square. Several ruined buildings surround the south side
        of the square, but a larger, intact structure to the north looks like a barracks. One lane leads southeast, another
        heads southwest around the hill in the middle of the town, and a third way meanders north. In the middle of the square,
        leaning slightly to one side is a weathered stone statue of a warrior. Clad in sleek plated armor, wearing a helmet
        adorned with wings, he clutches a fierce trident.</p>

    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <h1>Statue</h1>
      <p>&quot;Looking closer, you realise that this is a statue of Rydell the Orcbane, who, you know from legend, supposedly
        defeated an Orcish hoard that roved north through Morduin, pillaging indiscriminately until they came to the town
        of Thundertree. It is said that Rydell single-handedly annihilated the orcs and saved the town.&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h4>11. Old Garrison</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <h1>Description</h1>
      <p>The barracks appears to have weathered the years better than most buildings in town. Its rooftop features a simple
