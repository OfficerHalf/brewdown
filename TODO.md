## Table Styling

Tables are not styed at all, yet.

## Columns

Add support for blocks that span two columns, and also add ability to enable two-columns/page sizing with the following:
{options: pageSize=a4, style=two-col}
(Look at markdown-it-attrs for this)

## Ability Scores

{abilities: STR=15, DEX=13, CON=1, INT=13, WIS=1, CHA=9}
